# Scrollmapper Bible Databases: Introduction

Established on January 9th, 2014, this repository has evolved over the years. In 2025, we are excited to announce significant updates to support our growing user base.

## Consistent Sources

Previously, our databases were compiled from various public domain resources. While effective, these sources presented minor inaccuracies. To ensure the highest level of precision, we have standardized our source to the **ESword** project: [ESword Project](https://crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModDisp.jsp?modType=Bibles&form=MG0AV3).

## Scripting

Within the **scripts** folder, you'll find essential scripts for generating new format extractions from **ESword** source **.json** files, along with additional utilities.

These scripts serve multiple purposes, such as database building or converting books into various formats. 

Please note that **ESword** files are extracted using the SWORD-to-JSON Python package available here: [SWORD-to-JSON](https://github.com/wasdin/SWORD-to-JSON).

## Cross References

The advancements in technology have given us new advantages in biblical studies. When leveraged appropriately, AI can identify relationships and cross-references within scripture. Scrollmapper's mission is to harness technology to explore scripture comprehensively.

The cross-reference source is available at: [OpenBible Cross References](http://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/).
