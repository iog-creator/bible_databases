## Project Structure

### Formats Folder

The `formats` folder is the main source of biblical texts in various formats converted by our script from consistent accurate sources. It houses the converted data in multiple formats such as MySQL, CSV, JSON, YAML, TXT, and MD, making it accessible for different use cases and integrations.

### Scripts Folder

The `scripts` folder contains essential Python scripts designed to manage and extend the functionality of the Scrollmapper Bible databases. These scripts facilitate the creation, conversion, and management of Bible translations and related data.

### Sources Folder

The `sources` folder houses the source data files for various translations of the Bible. The folder is organized by language, with each language containing its respective translation directories. For example, English translations are stored in the `en` subfolder. Each translation directory includes data files (e.g., .json) and a README.md file with details about the translation.
