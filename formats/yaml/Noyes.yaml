      verse: 2
    - text: 'His substance was seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred

      verse: 3
    - text: 'Now it was the custom of his sons to make a feast in their houses, each
        on his day, and to send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink
        with them. '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'And when the days of their feasting had gone round, Job used to send
        for them and sanctify them, and to rise up early in the morning and offer
        burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, It may
        be that my sons have sinned, and have renounced God in their hearts. Thus
        did Job continually. '

        alone to tell thee. '

        merely, but who tread in the steps of that faith which our father Abraham
        had while yet uncircumcised. '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'For not through the Law was the promise made to Abraham or his offspring
        that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of
        faith. '
      verse: 13
    - text: 'For if they that are of the Law are heirs, then faith becometh a vain
        thing, and the promise is made of no effect. '

    - text: 'For the Law is the cause of wrath; for where there is no law there is
        no transgression. '

        be a matter of grace; that the promise might be sure to all the offspring,

        of Abraham, who is the father of us all '

      verse: 18
    - text: 'I speak in a way common among men on account of the weakness of your
        flesh. For as ye once yielded your members as slaves to impurity and to iniquity,
        in order to commit iniquity, so now yield your members as bondmen to righteousness
        in order to become holy. '
      verse: 19

      verse: 1
    - text: 'For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he liveth;
        but if the husband die, she is released from the law which bound her to him. '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'So then, if while her husband is living she connect herself with another
        man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband die, she is no longer
        bound by that law, so that she will not be an adulteress, though she connect
        herself with another man. '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'So then, my brethren, ye also were slain to the Law through the body
        of Christ, that ye might be connected with another, even with him who was
        raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God. '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'For when we were in the flesh, the affections of sins, which were through

        the old way of the letter. '
      verse: 6
    - text: 'What then shall we say? Is the Law sin? God forbid! But I should not
        have known sin, except by the Law; for I should not have known sinful desire,
        unless the Law had said, "Thou shalt not covet." '
      verse: 7
    - text: 'But sin, seizing the opportunity, wrought in me by means of the commandment
        all manner of sinful desire; for without the Law sin is dead. '
      verse: 8
    - text: 'And I, apart from the Law, was once alive; but when the commandment came,
        sin came to life again, and I died; '
      verse: 9
    - text: 'and the very commandment whose design was life, I found to issue in death. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'For sin, seizing the opportunity, deceived me through the commandment,
        and through it slew me. '
      verse: 11
    - text: 'So that the Law is holy, and the commandment holy, and right, and good. '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be it! but sin; that
        it might become manifest as sin, causing death to me by means of that which
        is good; that sin by means of the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. '

    - text: 'But if I do what I would not, I assent to the Law that it is good. '
      verse: 16
    - text: 'Now, however, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
        me. '
      verse: 17
    - text: 'For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is, in my flesh, any good
        thing; for to desire is present with me, but not to perform that which is
        good. '
      verse: 18

        law of sin and death. '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
        God hath done, who on account of sin sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful
        flesh, and passed sentence of condemnation on sin in the flesh; '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'so that what is required by the Law might be accomplished in us, who
        walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'For they who are according to the flesh have their mind on the things
        of the flesh; but they who are according to the Spirit, on the things of the
        Spirit. '
      verse: 5
    - text: 'For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit life and
        peace. '

        of God dwelleth in you. But if any one hath to not the Spirit of Christ, he
        is none of his. '
      verse: 9
    - text: 'And if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin; but
        the Spirit is life because of righteousness. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in
        you, he who raised up Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal
        bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you. '

    - text: 'So then, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live according
        to the flesh. '
      verse: 12

        the Spirit ye make an end of the deeds of the body, ye will live. '
      verse: 13
    - text: 'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God. '
      verse: 14

    - text: 'For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation
        of the sons of God. '

        will, but by reason of him who put it into subjection, '

    - text: 'in hope that even the creation itself will be set free from the bondage
        of corruption and brought into the freedom of the glory of the children of

        of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption
        as sons, for the redemption of our body. '
      verse: 23

        wait for it. '

      verse: 2

    - text: 'For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach,
        or if ye receive another spirit, which ye did not receive, or another gospel,
        which ye did not accept, well might ye bear with it. '

        God, the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, cannot annul,
        so as to make void the promise; '

        unbelief, in departing from the living God. '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called To-day, that none
        of you may be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. '
      verse: 13

        firm to the end. '
      verse: 14

    - text: 'Let us then fear, since a promise is still left us of entering into his
        rest, lest any one of you should appear to fail of obtaining it. '
      verse: 1
    - text: 'For to us were glad tidings addressed, as well as to them; but the word
        which was heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who
        heard it. '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'For we who believed enter into the rest, as he hath said: "So I swore
        in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest;" although the works were finished
        from the foundation of the world. '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'For he hath spoken in a certain place of the seventh day thus: "And God
        rested on the seventh day from all his works;" '
      verse: 4

        of another day. '
      verse: 8
    - text: 'There remaineth therefore a sabbath-rest to the people of God. '
      verse: 9

        works, as God did from his own. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'Let us then strive to enter into that rest, that no one may fall, as
        a like example of disobedience. '
      verse: 11
    - text: 'For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged
        sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, both the
        joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; '

        heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. '
      verse: 14

    verses:
    - text: 'For every high-priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men
        in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for
        sins; '
      verse: 1
    - text: 'being able to be forbearing toward the ignorant and the erring, since
        he himself also is compassed with infirmity; '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'and by reason of this infirmity he must, as for the people, so also for
        himself, offer sacrifice for sins. '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'And no one taketh this honor to himself, but when called by God, as was
        Aaron. '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'Thus Christ did not glorify himself to be made high-priest, but he who
        said to him, "Thou art my Son, I this day have begotten thee;" '
      verse: 5
    - text: 'as also he saith in another place, "Thou art a priest for ever, after
        the order of Melchizedek." '

    - text: 'Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications,
        with strong crying and tears, to him that was able to save him from death,
        and was heard by reason of his godly reverence, '
      verse: 7
    - text: 'though a son yet learned his obedience from what he suffered; '
      verse: 8
    - text: 'and being perfected became the author of everlasting salvation to all
        who obey him, '
      verse: 9
    - text: 'being addressed by God as high-priest after the order of Melchizedek. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be explained, seeing ye have
        become dull of hearing. '
      verse: 11
    - text: 'For while on account of the length of time ye ought to be teachers, ye
        again have need that some one should teach you the first elements of the oracles
        of God, and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food. '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'For every one that feedeth on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness;
        for he is a babe; '
      verse: 13
    - text: 'but solid food belongs to those who are of full age, who by use have
        their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. '

    verses:
    - text: 'Let us then, leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ,
        press on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from
        dead works, and of faith toward God, '
      verse: 1
    - text: 'of the doctrine of baptisms, and of the laying on of hands, and of resurrection
        of the dead, and of everlasting judgment. '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'And this we will do, if God permit. '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'For it is impossible that those who have once been enlightened, and have
        tasted of the heavenly gift, and been make partakers of the Holy Spirit, '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
        come, '
      verse: 5
    - text: 'and have fallen away, should again be renewed to repentance, since they
        crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame. '
      verse: 6
    - text: 'For the earth which hath drunk in the rain that cometh often upon it,
        and beareth plants useful to those for whose sake it is tilled, receiveth
        blessing from God; '
      verse: 7
    - text: 'but if it bear thorns and briers it is disapproved, and is near to being
        accursed; and its end is to be burned. '
      verse: 8
    - text: 'But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that
        are connected with salvation, though we do thus speak. '
      verse: 9
    - text: 'For God is not unjust so as to forget your work, and the love which ye
        showed toward his name, in that ye ministered and are still ministering to
        the saints. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'But we earnestly desire that every one of you may show the same diligence
        with regard to the full assurance of your hope even to the end; '
      verse: 11
    - text: 'that ye may not become slothful, but imitators of those who through faith
        and endurance inherit the promises. '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no greater,
        he swore by himself, '
      verse: 13
    - text: 'saying, "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply
        thee." '
      verse: 14
    - text: 'And so, having endured with patience, he obtained the promised blessing. '
      verse: 15
    - text: 'For men indeed swear by one who is greater, and the oath for confirmation
        is to them an end of all strife. '
      verse: 16
    - text: 'Wherefore God, wishing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise
        the immutability of his purpose, confirmed it by an oath, '
      verse: 17
    - text: 'that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie,
        we may have strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
        the hope set before us; '
      verse: 18
    - text: 'which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, and
        which entereth within the veil; '
      verse: 19

        for ever, after the order of Melchizedek. '
      verse: 20
  - chapter: 7
    verses:
    - text: 'For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who
        met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, '
      verse: 1
    - text: 'to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all, who by interpretation
        is first King of righteousness, and then also was King of Salem, which is,
        King of peace, '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'without father, without mother, without record of descent, having neither
        beginning of days, nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, remaineth
        a priest for ever. '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'Consider now how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch
        gave a tenth of the spoils. '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood
        have a command to take tithes of the people by the Law, that is, of their
        brethren, though they have come out of the loins of Abraham; '
      verse: 5
    - text: 'but he whose descent is not reckoned from them took tithes of Abraham,
        and blessed him who had the promises. '
      verse: 6
    - text: 'And beyond all contradiction the less is blessed by the greater. '
      verse: 7
    - text: 'And here indeed men that die receive tithes; but there he of whom it
        is testified that he liveth. '
      verse: 8
    - text: 'And so to speak, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham; '
      verse: 9
    - text: 'for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'If indeed perfection had been by the Levitical priesthood, (for under
        it the people hath received the Law,) what further need was there that a different
        priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called alter
        the order of Aaron? '
      verse: 11
    - text: 'For if the priesthood is changed, there takes place of necessity a change
        of the law. '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'For he of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, of
        which no one hath given attendance at the altar; '
      verse: 13
    - text: 'for it is well-known that our Lord sprang out of Judah, in regard to
        which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. '
      verse: 14
    - text: 'And it is still more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek
        there ariseth a different priest, '
      verse: 15
    - text: 'who hath been made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment,
        but according to the power of an indissoluble life. '
      verse: 16
    - text: 'For it is testified of him, "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order
        of Melchizedek." '
      verse: 17
    - text: 'For on the one hand there takes place an annulling of the commandment
        which went before, on account of its weakness and unprofitableness,— '
      verse: 18
    - text: 'for the Law perfected nothing,—and on the other, the bringing in of a
        better hope, by which we draw near to God. '
      verse: 19
    - text: 'And inasmuch as it was not without an oath that he was made priest, '
      verse: 20
    - text: '—for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with
        an oath by him who said to him, "The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou
        art a priest for ever,"— '
      verse: 21
    - text: 'by so much hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant. '
      verse: 22
    - text: 'And they indeed have been many priests, because they have been prevented
        from continuing by reason of death; '
      verse: 23
    - text: 'but he, because he abideth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood; '
      verse: 24
    - text: 'wherefore he is able also to save to the utmost those who come to God
        through him, since he ever liveth to make intercession for them. '
      verse: 25
    - text: 'For such a high-priest also became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
        from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; '
      verse: 26
    - text: 'who hath not necessity daily, as the high-priests, to offer up sacrifice
        first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; for this he did
        once for all, when he offered up himself. '
      verse: 27
    - text: 'For the Law maketh men high-priests, who have infirmity; but the word
        of the oath, which was after the Law, maketh the Son, who is perfected for
        ever. '
      verse: 28
  - chapter: 8
    verses:
    - text: 'Now the principal thing among those of which we are speaking is this:
        We have such a high-priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of
        the Majesty in the heavens; '
      verse: 1
    - text: 'a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord
        pitched, not man. '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'For every high-priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; whence
        it is necessary that this one also have something which he may offer. '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'For if, indeed, he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there
        are those that offer the gifts according to the Law; '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'who serve the mere delineation and shadow of the heavenly things, as
        Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle; for,
        "See," saith he, "that thou make all things according to the pattern which
        was shown thee in the mount." '
      verse: 5
    - text: 'But now he hath obtained a more excellent ministry, in proportion as
        he is the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been established upon
        better promises. '
      verse: 6
    - text: 'For if that first covenant had been faultless, then a place would not
        have been sought for a second. '
      verse: 7
    - text: 'For finding fault with them, he saith: "Behold, the days are coming,
        saith the Lord, when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house
        of Judah a new covenant; '
      verse: 8
    - text: 'not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the
        day when I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
        because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith
        the Lord. '
      verse: 9
    - text: 'For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after
        those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and on their
        hearts will I write them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to
        me a people. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'And they shall not teach every one his fellow-citizen, and every one
        his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least
        to the greatest. '
      verse: 11
    - text: 'For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their
        iniquities I will remember no more." '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'In that he saith, "a new covenant," he hath made the first old; but that
        which is becoming old, and worn out with age, is ready to vanish away. '

    verses:
    - text: 'The first covenant, then, had indeed ordinances of religious service,
        and a worldly sanctuary. '
      verse: 1
    - text: 'For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, wherein was the candlestick,
        and the table, and the show-bread; which is called the holy place: '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'and after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holy of
        holies, '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'which had the golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid
        on every side with gold, wherein was the golden pot containing the manna,
        and the rod of Aaron which budded, and the tables of the covenant; '
      verse: 4
    - text: 'and over it the cherubs of glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which
        we cannot now speak particularly. '
      verse: 5
    - text: 'Now these things being thus prepared, into the first tabernacle indeed
        the priests enter at all times, performing the services; '
      verse: 6
    - text: 'but into the second the high-priest alone once every year, not without
        blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people; '
      verse: 7
    - text: 'the Holy Spirit clearly showing this, that the way into the sanctuary
        hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing: '
      verse: 8
    - text: 'which is a figure for the present time, in accordance with which are
        offered both gifts and sacrifices, which have no power as to the conscience
        to perfect the worshipper, '
      verse: 9
    - text: 'being only ordinances pertaining to the flesh, which in addition to meats
        and drinks and divers washings are imposed until the time of reformation. '
      verse: 10
    - text: 'But Christ having appeared, as a high-priest of the good things to come,
        passing through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
        that is, not of this creation, entered once for all into the sanctuary, '
      verse: 11
    - text: 'not with the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, and obtained
        for us everlasting redemption. '
      verse: 12
    - text: 'For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling
        those who have been defiled, sanctify to the purifying of the flesh, '
      verse: 13
    - text: 'how much more shall the blood of Christ, who by his everlasting spirit
        offered himself without spot to God, purify your conscience from dead works,
        for the worship of the living God! '
      verse: 14
    - text: 'And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that, death
        having taken place for redemption from the transgressions under the first
        covenant, they who have been called may receive the everlasting inheritance
        which was promised. '
      verse: 15
    - text: 'For where there is a testament there must of necessity be implied the
        death of the testator; '
      verse: 16
    - text: 'for a testament is of force after men are dead, since it is of no force
        while the testator is living. '
      verse: 17
    - text: 'Hence neither was the first covenant ratified without blood. '
      verse: 18
    - text: 'For when Moses had spoken every precept according to the Law to all the
        people, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, and
        scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, '
      verse: 19
    - text: 'saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God enjoined in respect
        to you." '
      verse: 20
    - text: 'The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the service he in like manner
        sprinkled with the blood. '
      verse: 21
    - text: 'And almost all things are according to the Law purified with blood, and
        without shedding of blood there is no remission. '
      verse: 22
    - text: 'It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens
        should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices
        better than these. '
      verse: 23
    - text: 'For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made with hands, which is only
        a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence
        of God in our behalf. '
      verse: 24
    - text: 'Nor yet to make an offering of himself many times, as the high-priest
        entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; '
      verse: 25
    - text: 'for then must he have suffered many times since the foundation of the
        world; but now once in the end of the world he hath appeared, to put away
        sin by means of his sacrifice. '
      verse: 26
    - text: 'And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment; '
      verse: 27
    - text: 'so also Christ having been once offered up to bear the sins of many,
        will appear the second time, without sin, for the salvation of those who are
        waiting for him. '

  - chapter: 10
    verses:
    - text: 'For the Law but shadowing forth the good things to come, and not having
        the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices which they
        offer year by year continually make those who come with them perfect. '
      verse: 1
    - text: 'For in that case would they not have ceased to be offered, because the
        worshippers, having been once purified, would have had no more consciousness
        of sins? '
      verse: 2
    - text: 'But in these sacrifices there is a remembrance of sins every year. '
      verse: 3
    - text: 'For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away
